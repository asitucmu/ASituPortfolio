Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About me
My name is Anna and my pronouns are her/she. I'm currently a dual-degree MBA/MSPPM student at CMU and I will be going into healthcare consulting upon graduation. Prior to CMU, I worked in health policy research. I have a lot of experience with collecting and analyzing data as well as writing briefs and reports, but relied heavily on the insert chart function in Excel for data visualization. 

# What I hope to learn
During my summer internship, I strugged to make presentations that were visually pleasing and "to the point". I hope this class will help me develop the skills to express my ideas in a visual and succinct manner without relying on Excel. 

# Portfolio
Here is where I will store the data visualizations for class.

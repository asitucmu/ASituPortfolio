Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About me
My name is Anna and my pronouns are her/she. I'm currently a dual-degree MBA/MSPPM student at CMU and I will be going into management consulting at PwC's healthcare practice upon graduation. Prior to CMU, I worked in health policy research. I have a lot of experience with collecting and analyzing data as well as writing briefs and reports, but relied heavily on the insert chart and pivot table functions in Excel for data visualization. I am also very familiar with PowerPoint and Google Slides, but I could use some help with creating better visualizations and graphics. 

# What I hope to learn
During my summer internship, I strugged to make presentations that were visually pleasing and "to the point". I hope this class will help me develop the skills to express my ideas in a visually succinct manner without relying on Excel. 

# Portfolio
Here is where I will store my data visualization assignments for class.

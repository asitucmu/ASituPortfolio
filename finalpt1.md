## Final Project: Part 1

### Project Outline & Structure/Story Arc
My final project will be a guide for running a marathon. I will incorporate my own training data and race results with the following aspects of long distance running. 


1. Acheiving general fitness baseline
2. Choose a running plan (compare Higdon vs Runner's World)
3. Diet (daily)
4. Gear (fuel during runs, shoes, clothes)
5. Mental 
6. Logistics (where to run, planning)


My story arc will have the following components:
1. Set up: Marathong running is becoming more popular. A number of my friends and classmates signed up to participate in the Pittsburgh (Half) Marathon in May. 
2. Conflict: There are many challenges with running a marathon (time-management, weather, and running isn't enjoyable!)
3. Resolution/call to action: Proper training and mental preparation can overcome these challenges. And running is good for you, so run more. 


## Initial Sketches



## Data 
My data sources will include:
* My own running data collected from my GPS watch. Uploaded here: 
* Offical race data from race organizers. Sources:
* Qualitative data 
  * Different race plans (Hal Higdon, Runner's World). Sources: 
  * Diet plan for runners. Source: https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2017/03/marathon-nutrition.php
  * Supplemental tips for running like mental conditioning, tools to plan long runs. Sources: 


## Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand to complete my final project. It is a new tool that I haven't had hands on experience with yet and I can see myself using this outside of school work. My first task is to explore and choose the data I have. I'm choosing to do this first because the data need to be cleaned before analyzing and may take some time. I have collected years' worth of data on my training runs and around 20 race outcomes (half- and full-marathon). I hope to choose data for 2 race outcomes and compare the training plans I used. Next, I will develop a chart or graph to visualize the data I am comparing. 


Then I will build out a skeleton on Shorthand for my story. At this point, I think it is important to get feedback to see if the story makes sense and refine. After, I will create infographics for some of the qualitative pieces I have. I will write the narratives to go along with the visual elements. Because Shorthand seems to showcase pictures, I will find apporpirate pictures or animations to make the the story more visually pleasing.

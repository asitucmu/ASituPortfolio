## Final Project: Part 1

### Project Outline & Structure/Story Arc
My final project will be a guide for running a marathon and avoide hitting the wall. I will incorporate my own training data and race results with the following aspects of long distance running. 


1. Acheiving general fitness baseline
2. Choose a running plan (compare Higdon vs Runner's World)
3. Diet (daily)
4. Gear (fuel during runs, shoes, clothes)
5. Mental 
6. Logistics (where to run, planning)


My story arc will have the following components:
1. Set up: Marathong running is becoming more popular. A number of my friends and classmates signed up to participate in the Pittsburgh (Half) Marathon in May. 
2. Conflict: There are many challenges with completing a marathon from training (time-management, weather, and running isn't enjoyable!) to the race itself (hitting the wall part way through). 
3. Resolution/call to action: Proper training, mental preparation, and planning can help overcome these challenges. And running is good for you, so run more. 


### Initial Sketches
Below are my inital sketches for the final project.

#### Benefits of Running


### Data 
My main data source will be my own running data. I use a GPS watch to track nearly all of my runs. The data has running pace, location description, distance, and elevation. There are other attributes that are collected (like maps of the route, splits per mile, cadence), but they cannot be pulled all at once in a single file. I will select runs from the larger file and individually pull files for the addiitonal attributes. I want to use my own running data to highlight the effects of different training plans and dieting. My data sources will include:
* My own running data collected from my GPS watch. Uploaded here: [Garmin Data](https://github.com/asitucmu/ASituPortfolio/blob/master/Activities%20Garmin%20new.csv/)
* Offical race data from select race organizers. Sources: [Halfmoon Bay Results](http://halfmoonbayim.org/event/past-results//), [CIM Results](https://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-23616/)
* Hitting the wall research (between 43-52% of runners report hitting the wall during a race). Citation: Buman, Matthew P., Britton W. Brewer, Allen E. Cornelius, Judy L. Van Raalte, and Albert J. Petitpas. "Hitting the wall in the marathon: Phenomenological characteristics and associations with expectancy, gender, and running history."

### Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand to complete my final project. It is a new tool that I haven't had hands on experience with yet and I can see myself using this outside of school work. My first task is to explore and choose the data I have. I'm choosing to do this first because the data need to be cleaned before analyzing and may take some time. I have collected years' worth of data on my training runs and around 20 race outcomes (half- and full-marathon). I hope to choose data for 2 race outcomes and compare the training plans I used. Next, I will develop a chart or graph to visualize the data I am comparing. 


Then I will build out a skeleton on Shorthand for my story. At this point, I think it is important to get feedback to see if the story makes sense and refine. After, I will create infographics for some of the qualitative pieces I have. I will write the narratives to go along with the visual elements. Because Shorthand seems to showcase pictures, I will find apporpirate pictures or animations to make the the story more visually pleasing.

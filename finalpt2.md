## Final Project: Part 2

### Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback
Below are the first iterations of my storyboard (done with pen and paper). My intended audience is someone who is interested in running a marathon or someone who signed up for running their first marathon. I want to tell a story utilizing data to demonstrate why it is important to follow a training plan and a dieting plan.

### User research protocol & 3 interviews
I created a table with the script & questions and responses from the 3 people I interviewed. Because my topic is focused on running marathons, I tried to pick respondents with varying running experience, from a non-runner to someone who ran in multiple races. I started the interview by explaining that I want to create a story to encourage people to prepare for running a marathon. I handed the respondents the paper sketches I made and ask them to review them and I will follow up with questions. The script and questions are on the first column and responses are recorded on the following columns.

Main findings from my interviews included bookending the story with benefits (starting with benefits and ending with benefits), using more data for hitting the wall (such as showing my data for pace when I hit the wall), combining my result graphs for dieting and running plans, explaining why dieting components are important (such as why % carbs are important, why % protein important, etc.), and using more data for marathon runners (particularly, how quickly majority of marathon runners finish). 

In my next iteration, I plan to use personas to better explain the story (contrasting following a training plan vs not following one), move the benefits of running to the beginning, utilize more of my own running data, and adding more data to explain what it means to hit the wall. 


### Revised wireframes / storyboard
For revisions, I focused on creating graphs around hitting the wall because it's the main challenge to my story. Here are the revisions to my graphs that explain hitting the wall. The first graph depics hitting the wall 3/4 into the race.

This graph compares outcomes of proper training and dieting vs the race where I hit the wall.

I began combining the feedback into my updated wireframes, which I began building on Shortand. It currently outlines Preview here:

### User research protocol & 3 interviews
I created a table with the script & questions and responses from the 3 people I interviewed. Because my topic is focused on running marathons, I tried to pick respondents with varying running experience, from a non-runner to someone who ran in multiple races. The script and questions are on the first column and responses are recorded on the following columns.
